## Overview

This project estimates the electricity usage required to manufacture a target
number of products over the next seven days. Weather data is used to adjust the
predictions for the selected region. Efficiency is expressed as the predicted
energy consumption per product (kWh per unit), where lower values indicate
better performance. When multiple days show the same efficiency, the day with
the lower overall predicted consumption is treated as the best option.

This repository will stay in sync with your deployed chats on
[v0.dev](https://v0.dev). Any changes you make to your deployed app will be
automatically pushed to this repository from [v0.dev](https://v0.dev).
